# CS 3510 Spring 2022 Notes

During my time TAing CS 3510 in the Spring of 2022, I created a series of lecture notes for students that were highly detailed written copies of spoken lecture materials. These were well liked by many students, hence I decided to make these notes public for higher education accessability with hopes that future sections of CS 3510 at Georgia Tech (and beyond) would be able to leverage these as additional resources.
